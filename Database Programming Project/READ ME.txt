	2. Download and open vidogameDatabase.py Python file in VSCODE


	3. Open the terminal in VSCODE by going to the left upper-hand corner clicking 	"View" 	then clicking "Terminal"

	7. Go back to VSCODE and in the terminal make sure you are in the correct directory 	before running the file. For example, if my Python file was in a file called 	documents and then inside of a file called Python I would type 
	
	cd "C:\documents\python"


	8. Then you will type 

	python videogameDatabase.py

	12. You will then be taken back to the signup/login page feel free to try logging 	in now and you will be taken back to the log out page and can press log out when 	ever you please


	13. After either step 11 or 12 go back to oracle and run the select.sql file this 	will show the information you inputted into the sign up column, when you logged in 	and out, how long you were logged in for and your specialized player_id that 
	identifies each player that signs up
